# Linear Search and Binary Search

## Project Description

This project focuses on the implementation and comparison of two fundamental search algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search. These algorithms are essential for understanding basic search techniques in computer science and their efficiency in different scenarios.

### Linear Search
Linear Search is a straightforward algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends. It is simple to implement but can be inefficient for large datasets.

### Binary Search
Binary Search is a more efficient algorithm that works on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, reducing the time complexity significantly compared to Linear Search. Binary Search is optimal for large, sorted datasets.

### Objectives
- Implement Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms.
- Compare the performance of both algorithms.
- Understand the time complexity and efficiency of each algorithm.

### Technologies Used
- Python (or any other programming language of your choice)
- Jupyter Notebook (for demonstration and comparison)

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the provided scripts or Jupyter Notebook to see the implementation and comparison of the search algorithms.

### Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on approach to learning and comparing Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms, highlighting their use cases and performance differences.
